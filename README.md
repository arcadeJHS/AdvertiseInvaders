Advertise Invaders
==============
An "advertise ready" Space Invaders HTML5 porting.
Demo on: http://matteopiazza.org/stuff/code/AdvertiseInvaders

Save your score
--------------
The game saves/loads the best score saved on DB.
Simple PHP and MySQL scripts are provided to save best score.
- /source/DB.sql: create a simple DB with a table on which you can save game scores.
- /assets/php/config.php: configure your DB connection.

Tweet your score
--------------
You can tweet your score on "game over".

Browser support
--------------
Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Opera, IE10 (pretty good on IE9).
The game is quite ready to be played on a tablet (touch controls will appear) - tested on an iPad mini.


Issues
--------------
- No sounds on mobile.
- Better "resizing" support.
